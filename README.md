# Sprit-r

Sprit-r is a simple multi-platform app to create spritesheets, grouping same-size images on a single file.

You can customize the order and scale of the pictures, as well as number of rows and columns the spritesheet must have.

This is a personal project born to rewrite an old .NET app I wrote years ago to quickly build animation spritesheets out of Blender frames for some of my games.
Also, it's an attempt to learn the awesome [Atom Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron): it isn't finished nor tested for now and the code needs huge refactoring, but the core it's working.

The awesome logo is made by Meui: meuidesign@gmail.com

It represents the holes on the papers used by traditional animators.
